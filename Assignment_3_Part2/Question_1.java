// 1. Number Guessing Game:
//â—‹ Write a Java program where the user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and
//the computer tries to guess the number by generating random guesses.
//â—‹ The user provides feedback by indicating whether the guess is high, low, or
//correct. The program should be modular, with different functions for generating
//guesses, receiving user feedback, and determining the next guess.
